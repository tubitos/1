one chunk is 10,000 by 10,000   (may change at some point)

it needs to be square and have straight edges
models need to fit together with no gap

naming:

the file name is based on the chucks position in the area
example:  00,00.x   00,01.x   01,00.x   01,01.x   ...   99,99.x


the textures for the models are in the same folder as the model and are named the same as the model but with a "T" at the end
example:  00,00T.x  00,01T.x  01,00T.x  01,01T.x  ...   99,99T.x

textures:
MUST BE UV MAPS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
if not, then i will shoot you in the face, then make you do it again!
